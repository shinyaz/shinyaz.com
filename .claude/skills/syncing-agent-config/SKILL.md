description: Synchronize configuration between Claude Code and Kiro IDE. Checks CLAUDE.md vs .kiro/steering/project.md and .claude/skills/ vs .kiro/skills/ for drift. Use when agent config files are updated, skills are added or modified, or when the user mentions syncing settings between coding agents.

Synchronize agent configuration between Claude Code and Kiro IDE.

Copy this checklist to track progress:

```
Sync Progress:
- [ ] Step 1: Detect which side changed
- [ ] Step 2: Compare project-level config
- [ ] Step 3: Compare skills
- [ ] Step 4: Generate sync report
- [ ] Step 5: Apply changes
- [ ] Step 6: Verify
```

## File Mapping

| Claude Code | Kiro | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `CLAUDE.md` | `.kiro/steering/project.md` | Kiro version has `inclusion: always` frontmatter |
| `.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md` | `.kiro/skills/*/SKILL.md` | Identical format (agentskills.io standard) |

### Skills with path-adapted versions (not direct copy)

- `optimizing-agent-instructions` — Each side references its own config paths (CLAUDE.md vs project.md). Reference files (`references/`) are identical and can be synced directly

## Sync Workflow

1. **Detect which side changed**
   - If `CLAUDE.md` or `.claude/skills/` was modified → sync to Kiro
   - If `.kiro/steering/project.md` or `.kiro/skills/` was modified → sync to Claude Code

2. **Compare project-level config**
   ```bash
   # Strip frontmatter from Kiro steering and compare
   diff <(sed '1,/^---$/d' .kiro/steering/project.md | sed '1,/^---$/d') <(sed '1,/^## Skills$/,/^$/d' CLAUDE.md)
   ```
   - CLAUDE.md has a `## Skills` section listing available skills — this is Claude Code specific and should not be synced
   - CLAUDE.md has `# CLAUDE.md` header — strip when comparing
   - `.kiro/steering/project.md` has YAML frontmatter (`inclusion: always`) — strip when comparing
   - All other sections (Commands, Architecture, Critical Rules, Git Workflow) must match

3. **Compare skills**
   ```bash
   # List skills in each directory (excluding Claude Code specific ones)
   diff <(ls .claude/skills/ | grep -v -E '^(README.md)$' | sort) <(ls .kiro/skills/ | sort)
   ```
   - For each shared skill, compare SKILL.md content:
   ```bash
   diff .claude/skills/{skill-name}/SKILL.md .kiro/skills/{skill-name}/SKILL.md
   ```
   - Also compare `references/`, `scripts/`, `assets/` directories if they exist:
   ```bash
   diff -r .claude/skills/{skill-name}/references/ .kiro/skills/{skill-name}/references/
   ```

4. **Generate sync report**
   ```markdown
   ## Agent Config Sync Report

   ### Project Config
   - Status: In sync / Drift detected
   - Differences: (list if any)

   ### Skills
   - In sync: skill-a, skill-b
   - Drift detected: skill-c (description differs)
   - Missing in Kiro: skill-d
   - Missing in Claude Code: skill-e

   ### Recommended Actions
   1. (specific action)
   ```

5. **Apply changes**
   - Copy updated content to the target side
   - For CLAUDE.md → `.kiro/steering/project.md`: Add frontmatter, remove Skills section
   - For `.kiro/steering/project.md` → CLAUDE.md: Remove frontmatter, add Skills section
   - For skills: Direct copy (format is identical)

6. **Verify**
   - Re-run comparison to confirm sync
   - For `optimizing-agent-instructions`: compare reference files only (SKILL.md differs by design)
